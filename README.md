## Why, hello there ! ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Gabriel Chertier.<br>

But, Gabriel Chertier is the way my banker calls me when I'm about to buy crypto currencies and ruin my family, thinking I'm making the ultimate financial move.<br>
We don't want to emulate this, do we ?
I'm Gabigab to my father, but I don't feel like we have this kind of connection (yet).<br>
You ? Well, you can call me Gabriel. Or Gab. Or Gaby.<br>
Actually, you can call me **anytime**.

I'm a soon-to-be-a-dad 29yo junior dev. I started coding in early 2022, and still learning.
I strive to code better than I joke (which might be an easier thing to achieve than I'd like to admit).

**I'm currently looking for work, as an apprentice. I seek improvement and professionnal experience.**

### Skills

* While Neo says that he knows <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielcranney/readme-generator/main/public/icons/skills/javascript-colored.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="JavaScript" /></a>, I'm a bit more humble and merely work on it.<br>

<sub><sup>Stay humble, my grandfather used to say (well he actually used to say that the world is going to hell because I don't drink his favorite wine because I refuse to drink alcohol). Or did he ? Ah well, I never really listened anyway, I was drunk.</sup></sub></p>

* While Neo brags about his (easy) mastery of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielcranney/readme-generator/main/public/icons/skills/nodejs-colored.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="NodeJS" /></a>, I only use it to make my back-end work.<br>

* But Neo doesn't know about Insomnia as I do, nor Git (<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielcranney/readme-generator/main/public/icons/skills/git-colored.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="Git" /></a>) or even postman.<br>

* He doesn't know <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielcranney/readme-generator/main/public/icons/skills/postgresql-colored.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="PostgreSQL" /></a>, and yet, I do.<br>

All of that and I didn't **cheat** using futuristic technology that could end the carrier of, well humanity. (<s>scary stuff</s>)<br>
So, as matter of fact, I'm far superior to Neo.<br>
Don't choose Neo.<br>

**Choose me.**

<sub><sup>Pretty please ? I swear I'm funny around the coffee making machine</sup></sub>
